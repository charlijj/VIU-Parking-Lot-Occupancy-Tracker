<h2>Product Summary</h2>

<p>
Our product is an information system that analyzes VIU parking lot footage which lets users
know how likely they are to find parking spots in each lot. Features of the product are
calculating current and future parking lot availability from images that are collected on 5-minute
intervals. These images will also be shown to users to allow them to give fair judgment on how
our system handled the calculation which should be accurate within 10%. This is being
developed for all members of VIU such as the students and staff, and as such they will be given
the opportunity to select their preferred parking lot location(s) to fit their needs. If users choose
to create an account they will be able to track their session in the system and continue to show
their preferred parking lot availability across devices. If the user also enters their estimated time
on campus they will be shown what potential future lot availability looks like. The product will
be friendly to new users and easy to access the parking lot images and availability desired.
